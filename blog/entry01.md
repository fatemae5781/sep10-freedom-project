# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Medical Autopsies)

###### 10/11/25

## Topic I’ve Decided On and Why

The topic I decided on for my project is medical autopsies and how machines are used in this field. I chose this topic because I find it really fascinating how doctors and scientists use advanced machines to find out exactly how someone died. It amazes me that even when people are in different countries, machines can help doctors perform surgeries and autopsies with great precision. I was originally interested in detective work because I like solving crimes and how detectives use technology to catch criminals, like fingerprint scanners and surveillance cameras. However, I found the medical autopsy process more interesting because of the way machines and logic are used to solve mysteries about death. I want to learn more about all the different machines and tools that help doctors in forensic medicine and autopsies, and how they are making the process safer and more accurate.

## Backup Ideas

My backup ideas were to explore the field of detective work, especially how police use technology to solve crimes. I was curious about how fingerprint scanners, AI, and surveillance cameras help detectives catch criminals and find clues. Another backup idea was to look into medical surgeries, especially robotic surgeries, and how machines help surgeons perform precise operations, sometimes even from far away in different countries. But I decided to focus on autopsies because I think it’s amazing how machines help figure out how people died, and I want to learn more about the skills and technology used in forensic medicine.

## Sources

The four main links that I used to explore this topic were "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWW32okjhrc", "https://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.14.0/auto_ingest_page.html", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/390426", and "https://mymortuarycooler.com/blogs/news/exploring-essential-forensic-tools-and-equipment?srsltid=AfmBOoqSZxuvoC0rVYCKBhEJ_29syjoieZrrPguG8YSXvLn87A9da4ax"

## Engineering Design Process

Right now, I am in the first stage of the engineering design process, which is defining the problem. The problem I want to explore is how machines and technology improve the autopsy process and help doctors find out the cause of death more accurately. Next, I will research different machines and tools used in forensic medicine. I plan to look at articles, videos, and talk to professionals if possible. I want to understand what kinds of technology are used and how they work together to solve mysteries about death.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are how to google, and communication.

#### How to Google: 

It was hard to find good, detailed information because there are many sources out there. I learned to use specific words and phrases, like “medical autopsy machines,” “forensic technology,” and “advanced tools in forensic medicine” to find better results. I also learned to look at the titles and descriptions to pick the most useful sources.

#### How to Read and Understand Articles: 

I had to read carefully to understand complicated terms and how the machines work. For example, I looked up terms like “CT scan,” “MRI,” and “digital autopsy,” and learned what they do. This helped me understand how advanced technology makes autopsies more precise.

#### Communication: 

I practiced explaining what I learned clearly and simply. I also shared my ideas with my classmates and got feedback, which helped me improve my understanding.

## Next Steps

Next, I will continue researching specific machines and how they are used in forensic medicine. I want to learn about the newest technology and how it helps doctors do their work better. I am excited to make a presentation about how technology and machines are helping save lives and solve mysteries about death.
