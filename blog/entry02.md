Since blog one, I have been learning more about the machines and tools used in medical autopsies. I searched for information about virtual autopsies and the equipment that helps doctors find out how someone died. One interesting thing I found was about the virtual autopsy table. This is a special screen where doctors can look at 3D images from CT scans. It helps them see inside the body without cutting it open. This makes the process safer and less upsetting for families. I saw a picture of this table on https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-touch-table-known-as-the-Virtual-Autopsy-Table-for-presentation-of-for-instance-CT_fig2_283593703, and it looks like a big, touch-screen computer that lets doctors explore the inside of the body easily.

I also learned about autopsy saws. These are tools that help doctors cut bones carefully during an autopsy. I found a website that explained that modern autopsy saws can be operated remotely, which makes the work safer and more precise: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3326172.3326177. I also looked into LiDAR technology. This tool uses laser beams to create detailed 3D maps of different places. In medicine, LiDAR can help monitor patient movements or help in surgeries by giving detailed pictures of the area being worked on. I learned these information from this website https://healthjournalism.org/glossary-terms/lidar/.

Another interesting tool I discovered is the digital forensic tool used to analyze digital data from phones or computers. This helps forensic doctors find clues about a person’s death by looking at electronic evidence. I learned all about it from this website https://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/.

# How I Found This
To find this information, I started with simple searches like “autopsy tools” and “autopsy technology.” However, I got a lot of unrelated results, so I revised my searches to be more specific. I looked for “virtual autopsy table” and “autopsy saws” to get clearer results. Sometimes I had to change my words or add more details, like “how does a virtual autopsy table work” or “what is an autopsy saw used for.” That helped me find websites with detailed explanations and pictures. I also used trusted sources like research articles and medical websites to make sure I was learning accurate information.  

# Engineering Design Process
Right now, I am in the researching stage of the engineering design process. I have searched many websites, tools, and apps related to medical autopsies and forensic technology. Through these searches, I have found a lot of useful details about the different machines, software, and digital tools used in this field. I am gathering information so I can understand how these tools work and how I might incorporate some of their features into my own project. My next step will be to analyze all the information I’ve collected and start planning how to build or code my project, focusing on how the technology helps in medical autopsy.

# Skills 

Since I started this project, I have improved in two main skills: researching and reading more better.  

### Researching:
I learned how to use specific words and phrases to find better information. At first, I searched for broad terms like “autopsy tools,” but I wasn’t getting detailed or related results to my topic. After revising my searches to include words like “virtual autopsy table,” “autopsy saws,” and “forensic technology,” I found more useful websites and images. I also learned to look for trusted sources, like research articles, official websites, and videos from experts. This skill helps me find accurate information quickly and efficiently, which is important when working on complex topics like medical autopsy.  

### Reading more better :
I improved my ability to read and understand complicated articles and technical terms. For instance, I had to learn what “CT scan,” “LiDAR,” and “digital autopsy” mean. I read carefully, breaking down the information into smaller parts to understand each tool’s purpose and how it works. I also learned to identify key points in each article, like how a virtual autopsy table uses 3D images to help doctors examine the body. This skill helps me understand difficult information and explain it in my own words, which is useful for my project and future classes.

# Next Steps
Next, I will keep looking for more information about the newest machines and technology used in autopsies. I want to learn how these tools are made and how they help doctors do their work better. I am excited to create a project that shows how technology is helping save lives and find out the cause of death more easily.
