Topic: **medical autopsy**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* An autopsy, also known as a post-mortem examination, is a process used to determine the cause of death by examining a body after death. 
* It is a crucial tool in medicine, forensic science, and pathology to understand diseases, injuries, or unnatural causes of death.
* Autopsies help improve medical knowledge and ensure justice in criminal cases.

## Part A: existing technology
* I searched up "autopsy technology" and this is what came up 
  * https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12104169/

**Virtual Autopsy**

* Virtual autopsy uses special machines like CT scans to look inside the body without cutting it open. It creates 3D images of the inside of the body, which doctors can study on a computer. This method is less upsetting for families and faster than traditional autopsies. It helps find out the cause of death accurately.

**Digital Forensics in Autopsies**
* Some new tools help forensic doctors investigate death scenes using computers. These tools can analyze digital data from devices, like phones or computers, to find clues about how someone died. They help solve mysteries quickly and accurately.

## Part B: possible future technology
* In the future, doctors might wear AR headsets that show 3D images of the inside of a body during an autopsy. This means they can see and explore the organs without cutting open the body. AI could also help by automatically analyzing scans and giving a report about the cause of death. This technology would make autopsies faster, less painful for families, and more accurate.

   * A doctor could wear AR glasses to look inside a body and find injuries or problems quickly. AI could help identify issues like broken bones or diseases from scans, saving time and improving results.
